# Frontend Handbook

A few weeks ago I made de decision in the Frontend Handbook to delete the number of the chapter from the chatper slugs. If in the future I add new intermediate chapters, I'll break the URLs and I should redirect the old ones to the new ones.

However, I didn't change the current internal links, so they linked to broken pages. Now, they are fixed and there aren't any broken links.

# New Medium post!
