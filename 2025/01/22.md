# Frontend handbook

Today I've fixed some styles in the bottom cards of the chapters. There weren't any gap in this flex and on mobile it looked terrible.

These cards are embebed directly in my blog page, I should create a new component and remove it from there.

I'm also thinking about I18N. I want to translate this handbook to multiple languages and my first opti√≥n I think it'll be ChatGPT. I could translate the handbook to English, but I think that an IA will do a better job.
