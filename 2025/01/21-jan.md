Today I've continue with the Frontend Engineer handbook. I've completed the rest of the chapter 6 (functionality life cycle) and I pudhed it in the repository, so now is live in production ([spanish version](https://www.frontendhandbook.engineer/capitulos/ciclo-de-vida-funcionalidad)).

I also started this new project (I'm a little bit excited), a build in public repository where I'm gonna share our my progress in my personal projects. Also, English isn't my main language, so I hope this project helps me to improve my language skills. At the beggining, I'll write Markdown files and I'll push them to this repo, but I have some ideas:

- Write a newsletter, but I think my projects aren't so interesting xd
- Drop all these MD files in a docs framework like [Nextra](https://nextra.site/)

I like the idea of using Github instead of Substack or even X, because I think this is most agnostic, but we'll see.
