Today I've started a new project: reactioning

# Reactioning

Reactioning is a library for React applications to insert reactions in posts, comments, ...

- [GitHub](https://github.com/juanoa/reactioning)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactioning)

![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f3933d0-b9eb-4762-b92e-e7166dc38ffd)

The library is published in NPM. Now, it counts with the basic features, but the idea is to add new functionalities and improve the design/animations.

I also published a [X thread](https://x.com/juanoa_/status/1882833702029517025) with the development procress
